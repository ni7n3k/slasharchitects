								<h2>WHO IS SLASH?</h2>
								<p>Led by Şule Ertürk Gaucher, <!-- Founded by Şule Ertürk Gaucher and İpek Baycan Magriso,--> slasharchitects is a group of design enthusiasts. Performing architecture and urban design in every scale our design thinking enables us to perceive the built environment that surrounds in another perspective. Regardless of the typology or scale we see every subject as a matter of design.</p>
								<br><br>

								<h2>WHAT DOES SLASH DO?</h2>
								<p>Re-thinking various typologies of architecture through urban, operational and spatial potentials; Slash Architects pursuits re-writing the built environment within the urban context. Integrating every scale and area of design, we prioritize a sensitive approach to all.</p>
								<br><br>

								<h2>HOW DO WE SLASH?</h2>
								<p>Combining a number of professions that interfere with architectural design, Slash Architects derives its name from the word “slasher”. Today the word “slasher” points to a structure that embodies various expertise and therefore achieves a more holistic approach to design. As opposed to “one-man-does-all architecture” we aim to generate spaces as a more collaborative work integrating a variety of experiences and skills.</p>
