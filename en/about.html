                <p>Re-thinking various typologies of architecture through urban, operational and spatial potentials; <b>slash</b>architects pursuits re-writing the built environment within the urban context. Integrating every scale and area of design, we prioritize a sensitive approach to all.
                <br><br>
                Combining a number of professions that interfere with architectural design, Slash Architects derives its name from the word “slasher”. Today the word “slasher” points to a structure that embodies various expertise and therefore achieves a more holistic approach to design. As opposed to “one-man-does-all architecture” we aim to generate spaces as a more collaborative work integrating a variety of experiences and skills. Founded by Şule Ertürk Gaucher and İpek Baycan in 2013, under the name of glaister||gaucher architects; we renewed our organization as <b>slash</b>architects performing in different scales of design such as urban design, architecture, interiors and construction.</p>
