				<h2>H.C. Andersen's Laboratory of Curiosities</h2>
                <h5>program:</h5><h3>Museum, 4600m<sup>2</sup></h3>
                <br><h5>location:</h5><h3>Odens, Denmark, 2013</h3>
                <br><h5>status:</h5><h3>Competition project</h3>
                <p>The Hans Christian Andersen’s Laboratory of Curiosities is an immersive, playful and unique experience, which brings visitors of all ages to the discovery of the artist’s world. The new building aims at contributing to the future development of Odense city centre, being an attractive node as well as making connections between the different parts of the city, redefining new limits for the area and organizing the fluxes through the building’s up-and-down movements and its porosity. The varying heights, scales and movements of the museum allow anyone, from children to grown-ups to appropriate the building. It is experienced both from above and under, and procures sensations though touch and sight, as helped by an unusual and tactile facade material.

Just like the Hans Christian Andersen fairytales are written so that they can be read at different levels, the museum works on different layer of perception. You can choose the theme you prefer or the medium you like the most and make your own path through the successive open spaces where the items lay.
