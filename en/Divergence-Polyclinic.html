								<p>
								Located in one of the developing sites of Ankara, 520 square meters “Divergence Policlinic” has a three stories of footprint. The clinic is designed in stages considering the first floor to be built on the first hand. As designers we have considered the spaciousness of the clinics public spaces to be one of the most important elements and our approach was to generate useful atriums within the constrains of the existing building. The first stage was to create a polyclinic that inhabits the necessities of one. The radical division of service spaces and clinic rooms is also one of elements that shaped our design.
