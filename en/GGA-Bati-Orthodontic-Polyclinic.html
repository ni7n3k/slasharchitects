                  Batı Orthodontic Polyclinic is located in one of the most striking location, in Fulya Istanbul, facing one of the greatest green park and Ihlamur Palace. The main entrance is designed mostly as an open plan providing enough space for the lounge areas whilst the clinic rooms are planed arround the contours of the existing interior. Two corridors parallel to each other are enabling the ring circulation through the space. The reception desk located in the center of the clinic is dominating the two waiting rooms. Creating two different waiting room concepts; one side is designed as a lounge area while the other provides free circulation, sitting areas, bookshelves allowing the patients to feel cozy and welcomed.<br><br>
                  
                  The cold and sterile perception of a clinic is challenged via green zen gardens, warm material, colors and texture choices. The wood material chosen for the walls and the floor is smoothly being transformed to more modest materials as you go along. This transition is also emphasised on the formation of the walls of the lounge area inviting the patients to the interior of the clinic.<br><br>
                  
                  Clinic units are located on the west facade with the vista of Ihalmur Palace, creating a display window in order to emphasise the clinic identity of the building. Rotating panels designed for the facade act both as sun screen and as a way to maintain privacy and they can be altered via users. This interactive transformation of the wooden facade panels allow for variety on the facade.
