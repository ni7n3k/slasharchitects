				<h2>Panorama Polyclinic</h2>
                <h5>program:</h5><h3>Polyclinic, 220m<sup>2</sup></h3>
                <br><h5>location:</h5><h3>Bakırköy, Istanbul, Turkey, 2015</h3>
                <br><h5>status:</h5><h3>Under construction</h3>
                <p>The smooth transitions and forms in the circulation areas create warmth and coziness in publicly used places.  In a plan scheme that is dominantly linear, the circulation is located on the side that has maximum transparency and it leaves the clinic areas on the more isolated side. This contrast is seen on the material choices. The design concept of the space uses constrains such as existing pillars as a guide and joins them with a single curve. The intersection of this curve and the existing plan generates surprising and functional design elements in the project. The composition of public spaces that starts with the reception diffuses to the circulation area by creating specialized usages such as kitchenette and lounge areas.
