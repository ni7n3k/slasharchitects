				<h2>Fulya Dental House</h2>
                <h5>program:</h5><h3>conversion, dental clinic, home office, 80m<sup>2</sup></h3>
                <br><h5>location:</h5><h3>Istanbul, Turkey, 2014</h3>
                <br><h5>status:</h5><h3>Built</h3>
                <br><h5>contractor:</h5><h3><a href="http://aksmimarlikinsaat.com/" target="_blank">Aks Architecture Construction</a></h3>
                <p>The interior is designed as a transformation from an existing apartment into a dental clinic. The renovation now offers a fully functional polyclinic, comprised of an entry hall / reception desk and lobby, as well as an operation room. The space is evenly divided and its volume maximized by the simplicity of the custom-built furniture. The sense of hygiene expected in such an operation room overflows to the rest of the design, from the reflective surfaces to the use of varying tones of grey.
