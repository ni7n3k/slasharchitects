								“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Leonardo da Vinci
                <br><br>
								Be Smile Dental Clinic located in one of the most important streets of Nişantaşı İstanbul, aims to focus on dental aesthetics designing the best smile for the patients. Besides having a unique design for the clinic; one of the motivations of design has been creating a space that is simple yet has an impressive aesthetic approach.

								<p>
								The clinic is designed in a typical apartment building of 60’s which is a housing unit originally. The 170 sqm clinics program included three dental examination rooms and all of the infrastructural spaces that is necessary for a clinic. The expectancy of the client was also to have a spacious waiting room and a welcoming reception desk. For the designers one of the challenges was to de-construct the typical housing plan and create an atmosphere of a public space for well-being.
								<br><br>
								One of the most important interventions was to re-evaluate the existing columns and beams as they were quite a restriction in terms of having various heights and depts. The architects approach was to unite the circulation spaces as flux as possible. The idea of breaking the typical corridor – room typology has brought the idea of integrating arc surfaces to the existing corners.

								<p>
								The arc composition in design is sometimes used to smoothen the column beam relations and sharp corners. The arc in the entrances of the clinic rooms creates a frame and gives depth to the small square meters. The design language is reflected to doors, furniture and walls in a coherent logic.
								<br><br>
								The front part of the flat, which is originally the living room has been transformed into a waiting lounge that is connected to the reception desk area with a wide hall. The arc character of the clinic also reflects itself to the furniture that is designed in the living room. The cocoon-like digital cabins and sofas carry the same approach. One of the clinic rooms, that is used as a pre-examination room is located facing the waiting area, creating a window of the clinics identity. For the privacy of the patients a curtain is placed behind the wide glass of the clinic façade.
