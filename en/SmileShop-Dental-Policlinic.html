				<h2>Smile Shop Dental Polyclinic</h2>
                <h5>program:</h5><h3>Dental polyclinic, 220m<sup>2</sup></h3>
                <br><h5>location:</h5><h3>Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey, 2015</h3>
                <br><h5>status:</h5><h3>Concept project</h3>
                <p>The asymmetrical panels starting from the outer facade and flowing into interior spaces creates a sense of canyon experience. Dental Polyclinic that is located in Maslak Uniq Istanbul Shopping Mall, creates a striking appearance with its unusual concept. Space is cracked open by the circulation and the waiting areas which creates the perception of depth in the project. he service and clinic usages are located around the 3 solid walls of the space leaving the mediocre center open for easy access. This also helps to be able to read the usages of the spaces behind by the frames that are sticking out of the walls of the canyon wall. The spaces behind the panels around circulation are totally white, clean and simple which creates a strong contrast between the interior and exterior of the clinic box spaces.
