                <h4>The Smile Academy</h4>
                <p>
                The Smile Academy is a comfortable clinic with greenery, and a peaceful environment for both visitors and staff, designed by Slash Architects. The project site is on a boulevard in Gaziantep, one of the biggest cities in the east of Turkey.

                The double-height interior resembles a store typology, where the entrance has a big gallery opening with a huge glass facade and no other windows. Natural ventilation and natural light are particularly important elements, and the double-height ceiling inspired the designers for two examination rooms one on top of the other. The resulting “mega box” has a steel-structure and it is constructed on the front side of the clinic. Opposite, there is another clinic room “Mini Box” located on the mezzanine floor. These architectural elements appear on the main display window emphasizing the typology of the policlinic.
